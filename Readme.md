TODO: project description

## Ideas

This file is for storing ideas that may be added to the project only.

### IMPORTANT
- [ ] variable damage on weapons (e.g., 1d10)

### General
- [ ] Improved map generation
- [ ] items react to nearby spells (e.g., fireball makes a potion explode)
- [ ] have function to examine item in inventory
- [ ] perhaps ability to see monster weaknesses, attack power, def, etc... depends on # vanquished
- [ ] Item weights and maximum carry weight
- [ ] hunger and food items
- [ ] Simulate noise and monster hearing
- [ ] Hidden traps: squeaky board, pit, fall-through to lower level, teleport trap
- [ ] add debugging console: spawn item, spawn monster, etc.
- [ ] help button that tells all the keybinds

### Weapons/armor
- [ ] different types of damage: various melee (blunt, pierce, slash), fire, ice, etc.
  - [ ] add monster weaknesses (e.g., damage type)
- [ ] armour and weapon propreties that affect crit_chance and crit_mult
- [ ] More types of weapons
- [ ] More types of armour (maybe separate: chest, helmet, gloves, etc)
- [ ] Weapon and armor enchantments

### Magic (Potions, Scrolls, Powers, etc)
- [ ] add potion: Berserk - 50% more damage for 10 turns
- [ ] add potion: Clairvoyance - Lets you see the whole map for 1 turn
- [ ] maybe: magic proficiency skill, which multiplies damage to all magical effects

### Enemies
- [ ] Banshee:(Do not attack, but if seen, will scream and alert within a given radius)
- [ ] Enemy special powers (Ex: speed, strength, invisibility, etc...)
### Open Questions
- [ ] should we regen health very slowly over time? perhaps a character trait?

### Miscellaneous
- [ ] consider additional magic system: mana pool and spells/spellbooks
- [ ] shop keepers
- [ ] Higher crit chance for dragon enemy or overall powerful mobs

### DONE
- [x] Wizards
- [x] fully heal on level up!
- [x] expand Look function (around level) to provide more info (incl. HP left on monster, maybe attack power, def)
- [x] add scroll: Blink (and/or general Teleport)
- [x] N/A name:(Fast enemy(2 studs), but is weak and not very strong.)
- [x] add sfx for crit hits
